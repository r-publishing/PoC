#### RChain rpublishing Eve Arnold NFT PoC

The RChain Publishing rpublishing repo has been established to deliver a proof of concept NFT-like platform for the decentralised management of digital assets. This is being done with the Eve Arnold Foundation and is aimed at delivering a key set of technical and business objectives. 

The scope is as follows:

Technical Objectives:
Delivery of a PoC working against it's own shard that manifests the following flows:

1. The flow of publishing an asset with or without attestation as a publisher.
2. The flow of publishing an asset with attestation as an attester.
3. The flow of browsing and buying an asset as a buyer.
4. The flow of having sold an asset as a seller.
5. The flow of having attested to an asset that is sold.
6. This includes 3 hardwired roles of publisher/seller, attester and buyer. 7. And includes the ability to install and run the entire PoC including the rnode on a local computer.

Business Objectives:

8. Setting up a new entity under which the PoC shall be delivered (RChain Publishing).
9. Creation of an initial business plan with financials, market research, and USPs for the same entity beyond a PoC.
10. Creation of assets/content in support of the business plan.
